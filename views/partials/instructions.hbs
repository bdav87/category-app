<h4>Importing Categories</h4> 
<p>To upload a CSV, you can drag and drop your file or click the upload link.</p>
<p>After a file is submitted for import, you can leave the page and come back later to check on the progress.</p>
<p>
When importing new categories, the CSV headers described below must be present. An easy way to get a template to work with is to export your existing categories.
</p>

<table class='table table-sm'>
    <tr>
        <th>Category ID</th>
        <td>A unique numerical value that identifies every category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Parent ID</th>
        <td>Leave blank or set to 0 to create a top level category. To create a subcategory, set this to the category ID of the category you want as a parent.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Category Name</th>
        <td>Category names must be unique, unless they are on different levels (e.g. parent vs subcategory).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Category Description</th>
        <td>On most themes, the category description will appear at the top of the category page. You can use HTML in the description to customize the appearance.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Sort Order</th>
        <td>Sets the priority in which the categories are listed; 0 is the default.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Page Title</th>
        <td>The title shown in the web browser, as well as the main link text in search engines.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Meta Keywords</th>
        <td>Keywords relevant to the product. Separate multiple keywords by commas. Note that keywords are ignored by modern search engines.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Meta Description</th>
        <td>A short sentence (150-160 characters) summarizing the content of the category. This can be shown in the search engine results, although some search engines will instead show other content from the page that better matches the user's search query.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Category Image</th>
        <td>Set an image to appear on the category page (not supported by all themes).</td>
    </tr>

        <th>Category Visible</th>
        <td>Set the visibility of a category with <strong>Y</strong> or <strong>N</strong>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Search Keywords</th>
        <td>Product keywords to assist in your store's search.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Default Product Sort</th>
        <td>This determines the order in which products are displayed on category pages. Available values: 
            <ul>
                <li>use_store_settings</li>
                <li>featured</li>

        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Category URL</th>
        <td>The category URL, excluding the store domain</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Custom URL</th>

    </tr>

<h5>Restrictions</h5>
<p>
CSV files are limitted to 1 MB in size. As a reference, a CSV including data on 5000 categories is roughly 300KB (~ 1/3 the limit). If you accidentally upload a file that's too big the app will let you know right away and cancel the process.
</p>

<h4>Exporting categories</h4>
<p>Exporting categories is as easy as navigating to the export area and pressing the export button. A CSV file will be downloaded to your computer. </p>
